# Vello Golden Files

Reference images for Vello tile rasterizer testing.

## Overview

These golden files are generated by **AnalyticFiller** — the trusted reference
implementation for 2D path rasterization. Tests compare Vello output against
these files to detect regressions.

## Files

| File | Shape | Size | Threshold |
|------|-------|------|-----------|
| `square_6x6.png` | Square (7,7)-(13,13) | 20x20 | 0.00% |
| `circle_r7.png` | Circle r=7 at (10,10) | 20x20 | 0.50% |
| `circle_r60.png` | Circle r=60 at (100,100) | 200x200 | 0.10% |
| `diagonal_stripe.png` | Diagonal stripe 20px | 200x200 | 0.00% |
| `rectangle_aligned.png` | Tile-aligned rect | 64x64 | 15.00%* |
| `rectangle_unaligned.png` | Unaligned rect | 64x64 | 5.00%* |

*Rectangle thresholds are higher due to known differences in tile boundary handling.

## Regenerating Golden Files

```bash
cd gg
GENERATE_GOLDEN=1 go test -v -run TestGenerateGoldenFiles ./backend/native/...
```

## Running Comparison Tests

```bash
cd gg
go test -v -run TestVelloAgainstGolden ./backend/native/...
```

## Test Results Summary (2026-02-01)

| Shape | Diff | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| square_6x6 | 0.00% | PASS |
| circle_r7 | 0.50% | PASS |
| circle_r60 | 0.02% | PASS |
| diagonal_stripe | 0.00% | PASS |
| rectangle_aligned | 12.50% | PASS (known diff) |
| rectangle_unaligned | 4.69% | PASS (known diff) |

## Notes

- Golden files use **white background** with **blue fill** (alpha blended)
- Circles have small AA differences due to Bezier curve flattening
- Rectangle differences are being investigated (tile boundary handling)
